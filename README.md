# interwikipage_main_link_scraper
Normally when we open a wiki page, we get many references in the page. these references are often another wiki page all in all.
We might need to get the official websites of these links. Here is python code to do the same. I have used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases as my example.

This ipynb notebook helps the user to fetch all the official homepages/websites of the links mentioned in the current
wiki page which normally on clicking opens up a wiki page. But my code will help the user to list all the official homepage links.

feel free to use your own wiki page links to scrape relevant links.
